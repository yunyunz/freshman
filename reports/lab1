cv Webstie with using HTML,CSS,JavaScript

ABSTRACT
This lab is aimed to build a personal CV website with html,css style, and JavaScript language.
The basic process is follow the lab report step by step. First, get the original code through the
atom.Second, modify it and try to follow the format on the lab manual.Third, add the content that 
the manual wasn't provide to you, by doing that I do a lot research on website. I understood the 
code and the structure of building a website base on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

INTRODUCTION
The goal of the lab is to learn how to make your website easier to modify and with less work of
 changing the code.There are three files to seperate the code and each of them has different 
 function. CSS is the file for formating the website. JavaScript is the file doing background 
 running, like doing other action within the webpage.


METHOD
There are three files here I will describe it seperately:
1.HTML - File name: index.html
Using tag in html file is how it different from other languages like Java and C. The difficulty 
is becareful when creating your tag do close it after the content.When doing formating html has 
higher priority than css. 
By using this two lines of code: "<link rel="stylesheet" href="CV.css" charset="utf-8"/>", 
"<script type="text/javascript" src="CV.js"> </script>", it creates a connection with the 
css file and JavaScript file. Then css file will control the format of the website and JavaScript 
file will run some background method or action within the webpage which call them.

2.CSS - File name: CV.css
Most of the formating happened here.

3.JavaScript - File name: CV.js
Build a function call "" and call it in the html file.
